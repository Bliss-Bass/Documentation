# Setting Up Bliss Restricted Launcher

If your BlissBass builds comes with Bliss Restricted Launcher, then you have the ability to restrict itâ€™s access to various packages on the device, as well as set specific packages to auto-launch across multiple connected displays when booting the device into Lockdown mode (Default), or locking the device while in Admin mode (Other Options > Admin).

### Admin Mode:

Admin mode will display both the sprocket and the lock button on the top right of the display, and allow access to navigation, statusbar, recents, and other Android features by default.
