# Sound

Sometimes the results of running

```text
$ lsmod
```

does show that your sound is detected.

The next thing to try is to:

1. Open Play Store
2. Install "Volume Booster GOODEV" or any other sound booster app
3. Open the AudioFX app if installed and turn it off
4. Go to Home and open the Volume Boost app and boost it to 15%-25% and test

This will solve most sound issues. 

There is also tools added to Gearlock Recovery that can help with most sound issues. Read the details about that [here](https://supreme-gamers.com/threads/how-to-fix-mic-sound-issues-in-phoenixos-darkmatter.62/page-2).
