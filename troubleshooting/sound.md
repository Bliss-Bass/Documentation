# Sound

Sometimes the results of running

```text
$ lsmod
```

does show that your sound is detected.

The next thing to try is to:

* Open Play Store
* install "Volume Booster GOODEV" or any other sound booster app
* Open the AudioFX app if installed and turn it off
* Go to Home and open the Volume Boost app and boost it to 15%-25% and test

This will solve most sound issues. 

There is also tools added to Gearlock Recovery that can help with most sound issues. Read the details about that [here](https://supreme-gamers.com/threads/how-to-fix-mic-sound-issues-in-phoenixos-darkmatter.62/page-2)
