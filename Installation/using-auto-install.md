# Using Auto-Install

Android-x86's bootable USB Auto-Install feature will only work for Android 9 and below. and it requires a MBR or Legacy boot setup and not EFI.&#x20;

It sets a fixed size for the data image and does not allow for proper root as well. So if you still require the use of Auto Install, please note that we do not support this method as it is outdated.&#x20;
