## Booting into generic builds:

### Tablet/PC/IOT/IIOT/Game Mode builds

**!!WARNING!! - THESE BUILDS ARE MEANT TO REPLACE YOUR EXISTING OPERATING SYSTEM OR BE INSTALLED ON NEW HARDWARE. THESE ARE NOT INTENDED FOR DUAL-BOOTING**

**!!Notice!!**: These builds come with A/B OTA Update support, and might not work in Live mode. Only supported installer is the Bootable USB install method we include in the .iso.

##### Booting into the OS

(**!!NOTICE FOR BUILDS THAT HIDE GRUB!!**) When the device reboots, it will not show the grub menu by default, and automatically boot into the last known boot mode. In order to show the grub menu, tap shift multiple times while the initial BIOS boot logo is displayed. If done correctly, you will be presented with the Grub menu. If no keys are pressed, the bios boot menu will show a black screen afterwards while Grub is loading the configuration in the background.

Once the device boots into Grub, the top option or two will be our default mode (some builds offer specific boot options per CPU manufacturer: **Intel Default** or **AMD Default**) boot options.

While the Debugging modes can be found in the **Other Options** section of the boot menu.
