This is where Addons come into play.","Addons can consist of one or more of the following:","Patchsets - Single or multiple sets of patches that are to be applied on-top of the source when unfolding the OS.","Prebuilt APK's - An example of this is the Restricted Launcher Pro. We offer the free version of the prebuilt for all to include, but it contains branding that cannot be changed. But we offer the Pro version that can be rebranded and further customized as an addon.","Package/External Sources - An example of this is our Kiosk Launcher, as that requires the private source to be included in the OS in order to use it.","Script Addon - An automation script that does something or helps automate any point in the build process."]},{"l":"Patchset Addon Development","p":["The first example we will go over is for a patchsett based addon. For this, you will use a patches folder with a name following the addon_name. Along with a manifest .xml that links your addon as a .git. This will allow you to have a private repo as an addon and control access to it if needed."]},{"l":"Example patchset addon","p":["We have an example patchset addon for a change that can be found in /bigblissdrive03/bass-wg01/assets/examples/addon_templates/patchsets-network_options.

This location will be searched when the project is unfolded, and any manifest file found will be synced in the unfolding process. After sync is complete, any patches that are required for the addon will be automatically applied."]},{"l":"Manifest","p":["The manifest file should point to the path: vendor/bass/patches/patchsets-addon_name.

This document will try to answer a few of those questions.","What is bootable/newinstaller repo ? What is the purpose of it ? what does it contain ?","Bootable/newinstaller was initally created to handle the ramdisk.img, initrd.img and install.img creation, as well as packaging the final .iso/.img/,rpm file. This means it contains a set of scripts for the initrd image, another set of scripts for the installer image, and scripts to setup the filesystem and root environment.","How grub is handled in BlissOS ? How does it show first when normal AndroidOS boots straight to bootanimation ?","This is done by using the typical Linux method for booting with initrd.img, kernel, and system.img/ramdisk.img, where a grub menuentry is created that references the location of each img, and loads it like normal linux would. The initrd.img and kernel load first, then after zygote loads, the init.sh file takes over and set's up the remaining hardware dynamically, and then initializes the graphics composer.","How does it recognize PC Bios on reboot ? as normally there is Bootloader in Android devices!","See above answers","What are the different Partitions that BlissOS Requires for running? This is in terms of Developer point-of-view and not the user! Does it have same partition table as that of any Android mobile ?","See above answers, with the addition of the install process creating a data.img or data folder on the install partiton, and that is detected by the initrd startup scripts and set as Internal Storage.","What type of kernels BlissOS supports or in general an Android-x86 support ? are there any specific one's ?","Linux/Google Android 11/12 LTS kernels, with about 20-30 patches added on top to support our filesystem and modularize all the drivers or options."]}],[{"l":"Maintaining Proper Authorship","p":["One of the most important things you need to keep in mind while working on open-source projects is maintaining correct authorship.

Over time, this may cause the developer to quit releasing public source code or even retire from the Android development community. This has definitely happened before!"]},{"l":"Kanging examples (what you should avoid doing)","p":["'''Example 1:''' You're trying to cherry-pick some commits from a different repository, but keep running into git merge issues. Out of frustration, you copy the code from the commit, and then just commit it using git commit -a. Satisfied, you push it up to GitHub.","'''Example 2:''' You bring up a bunch of commits, and squash them before pushing to GitHub.","'''Example 3:''' You intentionally want to pass off another developer's work as your own. You cherry-pick the commit, and then amend the commit to rewrite the author information.","Let's go over why this is wrong. Example 1 is an example of an unintentional kang. You didn't want to resolve the git merge issues, so decided to just copy the code and commit it as your own. This is bad because the author information does not get transferred over with your copy, which you have to specify manually.","Example 2 is more of an accident. If you squash multiple commits, all authorship information for the range of commits is lost. In addition, it becomes a real headache for other developers if something in the range of your commits is wrong. Because you cannot individually revert commits in a squash, squashing is very much discouraged and should ONLY be used when you have a lot of commits that you committed yourself and are small in nature.","Example 3 is an example of an intentional kang. We won't explain why because it should be fairly obvious."]},{"l":"How to maintain proper authorship","p":["The process is fairly simple yet important to understand.","If you are cherry-picking commits, the authorship information is transferred automatically. Provided that you are running git cherry-pick, the entire commit information, down to when the commit was created, is picked into your repository. You don't have to do anything in this case.","If you are committing someone else's code yourself, then you must manually specify who the author is. There are a lot of reasons why you would do this, from merge issues to incompatible code with the existing codebase. To manually specify an author, follow the [[#Manually specifying an author | Manually specifying an author section below]].","Finally, do NOT squash a range of commits that are not your own. This completely wipes authorship information from the range of commits and causes a massive headache for other developers."]},{"l":"Manually specifying an author","p":["You need to first determine the original author's name and email address.","GitHub no longer shows the author information when you mouse over the profile picture, which is quite unfortunate. However, there is an easy workaround.","Go to the commit that you want to pick. [https://github.com/BlissRoms/Documentation-release/commit/5ae1c6c4441786cd3ad5bd1773c831ba13cd86bc We'll use my commit as an example.]","Add the word .patch, with the period, to the end of the URL and press Enter to navigate to the raw patch.","In the patch, find the section that contains the author.

Examples of others we add are here https://github.com/BlissRoms-x86/external_kernel-drivers/tree/r11-r36","The examples only add one Android.mk file, and the one I use is generic for just about any kernel module that has a standard MAKEFILE, not a MAKEFILE.am file.","So you should really only need to add your kernel module folder to external/kernel-drivers/ and copy the Android.mk into it, then build source as normal.

We use a grub flag to pass the password through to the system, which then creates a sha256 hash of that string and compares it against the hash saved within the system. In order to enter Admin mode, you must manually boot into Grub by tapping the ‘shift’ key while booting, and select the Admin mode menu option, then tap ‘e’ to edit. From there, you will add:","Where ‘your_companies_complex_password_schema1234’ is replaced with the password set in the source. Failure to enter the correct password here will result in the device rebooting into Lockdown mode.","In order to meet the strict security needs, changes in the bootloader are made to always default to Lockdown mode. So in the event of a failed password attempt, the device will reboot and boot back into the default Lockdown mode unless the user prompts the grub menu to show and enters the correct bootmode password in order to boot into Admin mode or Debugging Admin mode."]},{"l":"Creating a New Admin Password","p":["To create a new Admin mode password, you will need to generate a new hash and update the source file located at vendor/branding/security/blissmode_password. The supported characters for the password are (24 characters [a-z][A-Z][0-9][@#$%&]). To generate a new hash, we use the simple script:","In order to confirm that a set password is working, you can run a check on the hashed sum values from Linux: \\","We also leave feedback of a password check success or failure in the debugging shell at boot.
